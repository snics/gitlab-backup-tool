Um die manuellen Korrekturen auf ein minimum zu reduzieren, wäre es sehr sinnvoll erstmal die sicher nicht benötigten zu Löschen und sich dann nur noch die zu korrigieren die wirklich gebraucht werden.\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n\nFolgende Spieler werden nicht gebraucht\n\n- Spieler ohne Geburtstag (laut @Marius können keine Spieler ohne Geburtstag in den Portalen benutzt/gefunden werden)\n- Spieler die in keinem Kader in den von uns erfassten Spielen sind\n- Dubletten (wir haben einige Spieler von Hand angelegt, die später auch bei TM waren und deswegen über den Crawler nochmals angelegt wurden)\n\n### What is the current bug behavior?\n\nDie Korrektur der Fehlerhafte/Unnötige Datensätzen kostet viel Geld (da manuelle Arbeit).\n\n## Possible Solution\n\n1. Löschen aller nicht benötigten Spieler\n2. Überprüfen\n3. Korrektur der fehlerhaften Spieler-Datensätzen\n4. Dubletten-Zusammenführung\n\n\n### 1. Nicht benötigte Spieler\nNach einem Meet mit @jeong-ii kann ich in der Base2-Struktur wie folgt feststellen, welche Spieler nicht gebraucht werden:\n- Kein Eintrag in der Tabelle `match_player` **und** `player_performance`\n\nGelöscht sollten dann in folgenden Tabellen:\n- `player_squadholder` (Spalte `player_id` oder `player_national_team_id`)\n- `player_country`\n- `player`\n\n\n### 2. Überprüfung\n- Das es Spieler gibt, die zwar in `match_player` aber nicht in `player_performance` existieren, ist normal. Da es Spieler gibt die im Kader sind aber nicht eingesetzt wurden. Was es nicht geben sollte und manuell überprüft werden müsste ist, dass wenn es einen Spieler in der Tabelle `player_performance` gibt, aber nicht in der Tabelle `match_player`.\n\n### 3. Korrektur\nFolgende Spieler-Datensätze müssten Korrigiert werden:\n- Spieler die kein Geburtstag haben\n- Spieler die ausversehen aus dem Kader einer Mannschaft gelöscht wurden obwohl die im Kader des Spiels waren (und sogar Einsatzzeiten hatten) müssen dem Kader des Spiels wieder hinzugefügt werden.\n\n### 4. Nachbereitung\n- Doppelte TM-ID zusammen legen\n```sql\nselect p.transfermarkt_id, count(*) from player p group by p.transfermarkt_id having count(*) > 1;\n```\n- Dubletten zusammenlegen (Gleichheit: Geburtstag + mind. ein Spiel im gleichen Verein, Geburtstag + Name, mind. ein Spiel im gleichen Verein + Name)\n\nDanach kann für die Tabelle `player` der unique index auf `transfermarkt_id` angelegt

scoring_videosource sv where sv.match_id = t.match_id)\norder by t.id;\n```\n### TM-ID Duplikate überprüfen\nOb es Player, Match, Competition, Country, Seasons und Squad mit der selben TM-Id gibt\n```sql\nselect p.transfermarkt_id, count(*) from player p group by p.transfermarkt_id having count(*) > 1\nselect m.transfermarkt_id, count(*) from match m group by m.transfermarkt_id having count(*) > 1;\nselect c.transfermarkt_id, count(*) from competition c group by c.transfermarkt_id having count(*) > 1; -- Top (Alle eindeutig und keine Null)\nselect c.transfermarkt_id, count(*) from

eindeutig und keine Null)\nselect s.transfermarkt_id, count(*) from squad s group by s.transfermarkt_id having count(*) > 1;\n```\nWenn ja, dann folgendes noch als Migrations-Skript per Update hinzufügen:\n```sql\nALTER TABLE player ADD CONSTRAINT player_unique_tm_id UNIQUE (transfermarkt_id);\nALTER TABLE match ADD CONSTRAINT match_unique_tm_id UNIQUE (transfermarkt_id);\nALTER TABLE squad ADD CONSTRAINT squad_unique_tm_id UNIQUE (transfermarkt_id);\n```\n\n### Spieler ohne Geburtstag überprüfen\nLaut @Marius können die Spieler ohne Geburtstag eh nicht in den Portalen angezeigt werden (da wir immer ein Alters-Filter mitgeben).\n\nAus diesem Grund muss überprüft werden welche Spieler ohne Geburtstag existieren und wie mit den zu Verfahren ist:\n\n```sql\nselect * from player p where p.birth_date is null;\n```\n\nEinfach löschen, oder werden die Spieler noch für andere Sachen benötigt (Als Spieler direkt nicht suchbar, aber als Spieler im Kadar etc.)...\n\n\n### Matches und Squads mit ungültigen Referenzen (\"Dummy\") bereinigen\nDamit die Migration durchläuft, hat @jeong-ii \"Dummy\" Competition/Iteration/Steps/Squads etc. angelegt. \n\n- \"Dummy\"-Competition/-Iteration/-Steps werden den Matches, die keine Referenz zu einem Step/Iteration/Competition haben zugeordnet.\n\n- \"Dummy\"-Squads werden den Matches, die keine gültigen Home/Away-Squads haben zugeordnet.\n\nDie Matches muss man mal raussuchen, damit @Marius diese Matches in Base1 korrigieren kann und wir diese Krücke als Behelf nicht mehr benötigen.","state":"opened","created_at":"2021-03-11T14:25:32.399Z","updated_at":"2021-04-14T16:25:34.050Z","closed_at":null,"closed_by":null,"labels":["portal:internal","portal:tagging","status:Backlog"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":13,"name":"Rudolf

Bisher war es so, dass die Änderung von Events im Tagging (ohne eine Neuberechnung) keinen Einfluss auf die veröffentlichte Daten (Scorings) hatten, die Änderung an der Videoquelle (URL oder Sync-Punkten) hat aber direkt auf die Portale durchgeschlagen.\n\nDas wird jetzt durch die Änderung vereinheitlicht. Erst durch die erneute Berechnung eines Taggings, werden die Daten aus dem Tagging in die Portale übergeben bzw. überschrieben.\n\n## TODO\nDafür muss der \"Scorings-Berechnen und Veröffentlichen\"-Methode auch die Videoquelle übergeben werden.\n\nNach Absprache mit @Marius sollte vor dem Berechnen auch Validiert werden, dass es mind. 2 Syncpoints zu der Haupt-Videoquelle des Taggings gibt, ansonsten ist eine Berechnung (und damit Veröffentlichung) nicht möglich.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-08T13:17:41.483Z","updated_at":"2021-03-12T10:51:17.288Z","closed_at":"2021-03-12T10:51:17.277Z","closed_by":{"id":13,"name":"Rudolf Grauberger","username":"Rudolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/13/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/Rudolf"},"labels":["portal:tagging","status:Release"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":13,"name":"Rudolf Grauberger","username":"Rudolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/13/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/Rudolf"}],"author":{"id":13,"name":"Rudolf Grauberger","username":"Rudolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/13/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/Rudolf"},"assignee":{"id":13,"name":"Rudolf Grauberger","username":"Rudolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/13/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/Rudolf"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"web_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/Impect2.0/base2/-/issues/32","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.impect.com/api/v4/projects/64/issues/32","notes":"https://gitlab.impect.com/api/v4/projects/64/issues/32/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.impect.com/api/v4/projects/64/issues/32/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.impect.com/api/v4/projects/64"},"references":{"short":"#32","relative":"#32","full":"Impect2.0/base2#32"},"moved_to_id":null,"path":"base2"},{"id":641,"iid":31,"project_id":64,"title":"Add validation rule -

Selbst mit der Developer-Console kommt man nicht dran, weil diese Information das BE nicht verläßt.\n\n## Lösung\nz. b. https://stackoverflow.com/a/49431665 oder hier https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43555867/spring-rest-api-interceptor-add-response-header-on-each-every-request\n\nHintergrund-Informationen: https://stackoverflow.com/a/35856496","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-02T14:39:04.789Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T11:10:12.638Z","closed_at":"2021-02-03T11:10:12.610Z","closed_by":{"id":13,"name":"Rudolf Grauberger","username":"Rudolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/13/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/Rudolf"},"labels":["prio:Low"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":13,"name":"Rudolf Grauberger","username":"Rudolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/13/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/Rudolf"}],"author":{"id":13,"name":"Rudolf Grauberger","username":"Rudolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/13/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/Rudolf"},"assignee":{"id":13,"name":"Rudolf Grauberger","username":"Rudolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/13/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/Rudolf"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2021-06-30","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"web_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/Impect2.0/base2/-/issues/12","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.impect.com/api/v4/projects/64/issues/12","notes":"https://gitlab.impect.com/api/v4/projects/64/issues/12/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.impect.com/api/v4/projects/64/issues/12/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.impect.com/api/v4/projects/64"},"references":{"short":"#12","relative":"#12","full":"Impect2.0/base2#12"},"moved_to_id":null,"path":"base2"},{"id":614,"iid":11,"project_id":64,"title":"Request-ID nach Request bereinigen","description":"In dem LoggingInterceptor [LoggingInterceptor.java](https://gitlab.impect.com/Impect2.0/base2/-/blob/master/com.impect.main/src/main/java/com/impect/main/interceptor/LoggingInterceptor.java) werden bei jedem Request einige Informationen an den aktuellen Thread angehängt (wie eine ThreadLocal-Variable). Diese werden dann genutzt um das Logging um diese Information zu erweitern (im Text und als Struktur).\n\nDazu gehören\n```java\n        MDC.put(MDCKeys.RID.toString(), rid);  //\n        MDC.put(MDCKeys.RST.toString(), rst);\n        MDC.put(MDCKeys.UID.toString(), String.valueOf(uid));\n```\n\nAllerdings werden diese Thread-Bezogenen Daten nicht wieder bereinigt. Würde der Thread gekillt, wäre das soweit auch kein Problem. Wenn man aber mit ThreadPools arbeitet, dann ist es so, dass ein Thread wiederverwendet wird und damit auch die Kontext-Variablen. Wenn ausschließlich Webrequest ausgeführt werden, dann ist das auch kein Problem, da jeder Webrequest die Daten überschreibt.\n\n## Problem\nWir nutzen verschiedene Möglichkeiten wie der Quellcode ausgeführt werden kann (z. B. @Scheduled). Diese bekommen dann einfach ein Thread aus dem ThreadPool und haben somit noch gesetzte Request-Ids etc. die beim Loggen einfach mit gegeben werden. Das führt dazu, das Logs zu einer Request-ID gefunden werden die nicht dazu gehören. (Beispiel: [Log](https://kibana.impect.com/app/infra#/logs?_g=()&flyoutOptions=(flyoutId:!n,flyoutVisibility:hidden,surroundingLogsId:!n)&logFilter=(expression:'app.rid%20:%20%223c9052a5-2b43-4b6c-9d0b-afe6c16c232c%22',kind:kuery)&logPosition=(position:(tiebreaker:3383033,time:1612273084281),streamLive:!f)) hier gibt es noch nach dem `Request Logging Interceptor after Completion` weitere Logs, die nicht zum Request gehören)\n\n## Lösung\nEine mögliche Lösung könnte wie folgt implementiert werden:

B. `createMatch[Details]Job`, `createPlayerJob` etc.\n- Da der Aufrufer ja ein fremdes Modul ist, dass ggf. die Information über den Job and FE weiterleiten muss und das FE ggf. den Job-Zustand überprüfen möchte, sollte das zurückgegebene DTO die URL oder die Job-ID beinhalten.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-31T09:13:33.605Z","updated_at":"2021-02-16T10:41:11.976Z","closed_at":"2021-02-16T10:41:11.962Z","closed_by":{"id":13,"name":"Rudolf Grauberger","username":"Rudolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/13/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/Rudolf"},"labels":[],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":2,"name":"Matthias Sienz","username":"matthias","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f189e531f05693bb5146354140b77d1e?s=80&d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/matthias"}],"author":{"id":13,"name":"Rudolf Grauberger","username":"Rudolf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/13/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/Rudolf"},"assignee":{"id":2,"name":"Matthias Sienz","username":"matthias","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f189e531f05693bb5146354140b77d1e?s=80&d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/matthias"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"web_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/Impect2.0/base2/-/issues/4","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.impect.com/api/v4/projects/64/issues/4","notes":"https://gitlab.impect.com/api/v4/projects/64/issues/4/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.impect.com/api/v4/projects/64/issues/4/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.impect.com/api/v4/projects/64"},"references":{"short":"#4","relative":"#4","full":"Impect2.0/base2#4"},"moved_to_id":null,"path":"base2"},{"id":583,"iid":318,"project_id":5,"title":"DB Events","description":"@matthias \n\n**Pentalty Kick**\n\nBitte jedes getaggte PENALTY_KICK (ohne Shot at Goal Zusatz) Event in PENALTY_KICK(Shot at Goal) umändern.

Ziel ist es, diesen Export zu reparieren und zu vervollständigen, und alle relevanten KPI Vektoren eines Spiels in einer csv File zusammenzufassen.\n\n1) Im bestehenden Event Export sind die Vektoren zur Zeit alle leer -- hier bitte den Export reparieren, so dass die Vektoren korrekt berechnet sind.\n\n2) Falls der bestehende Export nicht für alle relevanten KPI Vektoren funktioniert, bitte erweitern. Wir haben insgesamt 12 relevante KPIs auf Vektorenbasis: Imp_Chances, Op, Op_2nd, Op_SP, Or, Np, Rp, Ro, At, Ao, Rt, CritBl. Wir gehen davon aus, dass wir Op_2nd und Op_SP aus Op, und CritBl aus Rt berechnen können, es bleiben also 9 relevante Vektoren übrig.\n\n3) Bitte folgende beschreibende Variablen hinzufügen: MatchID, Team, TeamID, SpielerID.\n\n4) Bitte alle KPI Vektoren, auf die ein Einzelevent Einfluss nimmt, auf der gleichen Zeile zusammenfassen, so dass es nur noch einen Gesamteinzelexport pro Spiel gibt. Hierbei muss die Bezeichnung des Patterns und der Vektoren angepasst werden, da diese Variablen für verschiedene KPIs unterschiedlich sind -- z.B. \"Op_Pattern\" anstatt nur \"Pattern\" und \"Op_R1\" anstatt \"1\" usw.\n\n5) Wir haben zur Zeit keinen Zugriff auf TaggerIDs, nur MatchIDs -- bitte den Event Export Link auf MatchIDs anstatt TaggerIDs beziehen. Alternativ bitte den Rangexport um TaggerIDs erweitern.\n\n6) Idealerweise gibt es eine Möglichkeit eine Liste von Spielen (anstatt nur ein Spiel) automatisiert herunterzuladen  -- geringste Priorität, da wir das auch schnell in unserem System kodieren können.\n\nAngehängt findet ihr ein Beispiel, wo wir die Op und Ro Event Exporte Stand heute für das Spiel mit der TaggerID 11136 zusammengefasst und um die Variablen von 3) erweitert haben.[Beispiel_EventExport_11136.csv](/uploads/7f6e805bfb822e23b0c386d9c3a0273a/Beispiel_EventExport_11136.csv)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-21T12:46:15.579Z","updated_at":"2020-05-29T14:43:00.863Z","closed_at":"2020-05-29T14:43:00.840Z","closed_by":{"id":12,"name":"Armin Fatemi","username":"armin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/954c4bce6840cb586c8c7c87a1e5bf5a?s=80&d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.impect.com/armin"},"labels":["prio:High","status:Done"],"milestone":{"id":18,"iid":7,"project_id":5,"title":"Betting Export vervollständigen","description":"## Description\r\n\r\nBetting Export in der Form erweitern, dass alle für das Betting relevante Informationen enthalten sind und der Export performant ausführbar ist.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\n\r\n* [ ]  Export um restliche KPIs erweitern [#172](https://git.impect.com/impect/Base/issues/172)\r\n* [ ]  Memory Leak Probleme des Export lösen [#172](https://git.impect.com/impect/Base/issues/172)\r\n* [ ]  KPI Bezeichnung im Export auf gegebene Variablennamen umbenennen [#181](https://git.impect.com/impect/Base/issues/181)\r\n* [ ]  Export um Ränge erweitern \r\n* [ ]  Performance Issues der Ergänzung der Ränge beheben\r\n* [ ]  Anzahl der GoalScoringAttempts hinzufügen [#182](https://git.impect.com/impect/Base/issues/182)\r\n* [ ]  DangerZone für GoalScoringsAttempts hinzufügen (inkl.

An diese Liste müssen die ELO Werte gemerged werden mithilfe der ELO Teamnamen zu verschiedenen Zeitpunkten. Außerdem müssen die Transfermarkt Werte zu verschiedenen Zeitpunkten drangemerged werden. Das Ergebnis ist eine Liste mit allen unseren Teams, einigen ELO Werten und (hoffentlich) allen Marktwerten. Damit wir eine komplette ELO Wert-Abdeckung erreichen kommen jetzt folgende Schritte:\n\nWir logarithmieren die Transfermarkt-Werte: x = log(Marktwert).\nWir erstellen eine einfache OLS-Regression. Das ganze sieht ungefähr so aus: https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/javadocs/api-3.3/org/apache/commons/math3/stat/regression/SimpleRegression.html Kurze Erklärung: Wir haben ja jetzt unsere x Werte (logaritmierte Marktwerte) und unsere y Werte(Club-ELOs). Jetzt regressieren wir y auf x. Die Funktion heißt glaube ich einfach nur regress() und benötigt eigentlich nur die y Werte und x Werte. Nachdem regress() durchgelaufen ist, muss man jetzt die geschätzten y \"predicten\". Das sind die einzigen Funktionen, die wir benötigen. Erst regress, dann predict. Jetzt haben wir quasi auch alles. 1. Wir haben die echten ELO-Werte (y) und 2. die (über den MV) geschätzten ELO-werte die bei predict() herauskommen. Und jetzt nehmen wir einfach immer dann, wenn ein team nicht von ClubELO geführt wird (also wenn y leer ist), das geschätzte y. Und wenn es ein von ClubELO geführtes team ist (also y wert vorhanden) dann nehmen wir zu 50% den echten ELO Wert und zu 50% den geschätzten ELO Wert.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-23T09:54:16.950Z","updated_at":"2020-10-21T08:29:45.923Z","closed_at":"2020-10-21T08:29:45.775Z","closed_by":{"id":4,"name":"Jeong-Il

Dies bewirkt aber auch, dass Spieltage, die in der Zukunft liegen, teilweise unerwünscht gelöscht werden. Es betrifft vor allem die \"exotischeren\" Ligen wie Kolumbien etc., die anscheinend bei transfermarkt.de nicht im Vorhinein befüllt werden.\n\nZusätzliches Problem ist, dass auf transfermarkt.de Spieltage teilweise nicht korrekt verlinkt werden, bspw liefert Spieltag 7 der Kolumbianischen Liga momentan einen 404er. Dies bewirkt, dass der Crawler an dieser Stelle abbricht und somit die neuen Spieltage nach Spieltag 7 nicht wie erwünscht hineingeladen werden.\n\nDaher wird die automatisierte Löschung der

entfernt.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-08T10:29:03.854Z","updated_at":"2019-10-16T13:05:09.590Z","closed_at":"2019-10-16T13:05:09.488Z","closed_by":{"id":4,"name":"Jeong-Il

Spieler im gesamten Tagging zu ersetzen. Dabei sollte dann folgende Entitäten angepasst werden (hier müssen einfach die PlayerIDs getauscht werden):\n\n*  Exchanges\n*  Events\n*  PlayerMatchParticipation\n\nSofern ein Match schon berechnete Match Statistics hat, sollten auch diese automatisch neu berechnet werden. Das ganze lässt sich im FE umsetzen, indem @sebastian einfach die ganzen Endpoints mit UPDATE Calls ansteuert. Es lässt sich aber auch im BE umsetzen, indem man einen eigenen Endpoint dafür baut, dem man nur alte und neue PlayerId sowie die TaggingId übergibt. Hier müsste man nur gucken, dass man sich im Anschluss alle Daten über den Websocket neu lädt oder das gesamte Tagging als Response zurück schickt. \n\nMir ist es egal, wo wir es machen. Ich sehe es tendenziell eher im BE bin da aber offen. Klären wir, wenn Sebastian wieder aus dem Urlaub zurück ist. Daher geht das Ticket auch an @sebastian.

Wenn der Tagger über 5 Sekunden keinen Ping erhält, bekommt er ein ConnectionLost.  \n[19:29, 3.7.2019] Daniel Sabinasz: Nun ist es so, dass sendPing eine synchronized Methode ist, so dass die Funktion immer nur einmal gleichzeitig läuft  \n[19:29, 3.7.2019] Daniel Sabinasz: und sie ruft eine andere synchronized Methode auf, nämlich sendText in der selben Klasse  \n[19:29, 3.7.2019] Daniel Sabinasz: nun scheint es so zu sein, dass immer wenn refreshTaggingStatistics die sendPing Methode nicht läuft  \n[19:31, 3.7.2019] Daniel Sabinasz: Meine Theorie ist, dass immer nur eine geschedulte synchronized Methode gleichzeitig laufen kann, da die Klassen nämlich ansonsten nicht miteinander zu interagieren scheinen und auch keine gemeinsamen Methoden aufrufne  \n[19:32, 3.7.2019] Daniel Sabinasz: alternativ könnte es sein, dass über Spring implizit irgendwelche gemeinsamen Subroutinen aufgerufen werden  \n[19:33, 3.7.2019] Daniel Sabinasz: die ebenfall synchronized sind und sich deshalb gegenseitig blockieren  \n[19:35, 3.7.2019] Daniel Sabinasz: Aber so ein abgefucktes Thread Koordinations Gedöns ist echt abgefuckt zu debuggen  \n[19:35, 3.7.2019] Daniel Sabinasz: erst recht

machen.\n\nDieser Fehler ist somit Teil des Tickets #45, weil die Updates bei den einzelnen Taggern nicht korrekt erfolgen können.  \n\nStacktrace:\n\n    2019-04-25_14:35:05.338 [SockJS-6] [ERROR]

Analyse__  \nDas Problem besteht schon vor dem Update auf EntityManager Persistierung.  \n\nProblem ist in der Hilfsfunktion 'updateEntityAttributes'.  \nEs wird dort ein Objektbaum zum Update durchgearbeitet. Es wird bei der Behandlung von Properties unterschiedlich verfahren:\n- null\n- List und Set (nicht wirklich Collection)\n- Objekte\n\nBeim Traversieren der Objekte werden deren Properties grob unterteilt in Entity-Objekte und Werte. (Werte können theoretisch auch Objekte sein; Entity-Objekte sind in der DB abspeicherbar bzw. von dort zu laden.)\n\nProblem ist, dass nicht der ganze Objektbaum korrekt durchtravesiert wird. Am Ende der Traversierung schien es so, dass das Entity-Object nicht als solches erkannt wurde. Deswegen wird es dann auch später als detached Entity behandelt und der Prozess schlägt mit einer Exception fehl.\n\nIch denke, dass zur Behebung unbedingt Tests geschrieben werden müssen.\nDie Funktionalität der Methode ist eher komplex und sollte vollständig verstanden sein.  \nAuch Matthias hat direkt verlautbaren lassen, dass es ein kritischer Punkt ist, der nicht einfach angefasst werden sollte.\n\n_Proof of Concept_  \nUnter __git:features/DbStringTranslationProblem__ ist die betroffende Methode extrahiert und in die eigene Klassen 'com.mycardbox.data_access.EntityAttributeUpdater' ausgelagert.  \nSie schmeisst die Exception nicht mehr.  \nEs ist fraglich, ob die Traversierungen jetzt jedoch vollständig, korrekt durchlaufen.\n\n_Kleine (nervige) Nebenerscheinung:_  \nDas ExtJs rief beim Testen den Update auf dem Controller jeweils zweimal auf.  \nSomit waren es 2 Prozesse die gleichzeitig dasselbe gemacht haben.  \nZum Analysieren und nachstellen ist dies nervig, da die Logs nicht sauber auf einen Vorgang/Prozess betrachtet werden können.  \nIch habe eine __WaitUtil.java__ eingeführt, die Aufrufe geordnet (FIFO) abarbeiten kann.\n\n\n__Ursprüngliche Exception:__  \n\n    2019-03-08_12:45:33.396 [http-nio-8082-exec-8] [ERROR]

Siehe z.B. _GenericRestService.update()_.  \nMeiner Meinung nach, müssen die Securitychecks, soweit 'aussen' wie möglich erfolgen. Umgekehrt würde es sonst heissen, dass die DB Interaktionen (bzw. Data-Layer) nur über die wenigen definierten Methoden erfolgen _müssen_. \nDieses müssen erzeugt Restriktionen, die Funktionalitäten an anderer Stelle evtl. stark behindern.
